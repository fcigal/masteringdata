# What are Data Structures?

## What is the algorithm?
<div align="justify">
<p>If we consider the algorithm independently of the computer, we can describe it as a method of reaching a goal in daily life or solving a problem step by step. But our point of view here should be to adopt the logic of programming.

<p>Algorithms are a set of operations that have a beginning and an end, the details of which are specified. We determine the solutions ways and their order and solve the problem so that we can get the result we want.

<p>We use flowcharts to better understand algorithms. Every shape here means something. From the introduction to the conclusion, each operation of the algorithm is explained with a figure.

We figured out what the algorithm is. Now let’s move on to our main topic.

## What are Data Structures?
<div align="justify">
<p>In fact, in the introduction to programming, the first thing to ask is “What is an algorithm?” We are faced with the question. But when we dig deeper, we see that the main issue is data structures. So what are these data structures?

<p>The data structure is the structure used for the efficient storage and processing of data in a computer environment. Data structures are the building blocks that determine the way data is organized. Data structures are widely used in almost every field of computer science for simple and complex calculations. Data structures are primarily divided into two parts.

- Primitive Data Structures
- Non-Primitive Data Structures

These data structures will be examined separately.

## Why should we use data structures?
<div align="justify">
<p>When writing a program, or creating an algorithm, we can initially proceed with simple steps. But as we progress, the program we write will start to become more complex and the amount of data usage will increase indirectly. It causes performance degradation due to program complexity. To get rid of this underperformance, we need data structures.

<p>Some advantages of data structures.

- Data Storage
- Data Transfer
- Sorting Operations
- Indexing
- Search

## Why C language?
<div align="justify">
<p>The C language does not have data structures. If we want any one of these data structures, then we should develop our code. When we are understanding the operations of these data structures in detail and we are observing them very closely, C is a suitable language for programming on that. C is the most suitable and perfect language for learning data structure.

## Program Solving and Programming
<div align="justify">
<p>Programming can be learned in just a few days. But problem-solving is a lifetime. Work programming means the syntax, languages, or anyone of the language. Then problem-solving you should be good at mathematics than if you are solving a problem. The solution you will be given in mathematics.
