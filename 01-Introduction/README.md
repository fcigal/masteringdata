# What are Data Structures?

<h3>What is the algorithm?</h3>

  <br/>
<p>If we consider the algorithm independently of the computer, we can describe it as a method of reaching a goal in daily life or solving a problem step by step. But our point of view here should be to adopt the logic of programming.

<p>Algorithms are a set of operations that have a beginning and an end, the details of which are specified. We determine the solutions ways and their order and solve the problem so that we can get the result we want.

<p>We use flowcharts to better understand algorithms. Every shape here means something. From the introduction to the conclusion, each operation of the algorithm is explained with a figure.
